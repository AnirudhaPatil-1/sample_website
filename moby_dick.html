        The <a href="https://softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform
        was designed mainly for ebooks like the
        <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>book
        </a>
        and
        <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"></a>
          <em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a> , but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the
        novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as Moby Dick). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.

        <a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="blank" rel="noopener"><em>Moby Dick</em></a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael</span>. some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have  of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em>- is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
